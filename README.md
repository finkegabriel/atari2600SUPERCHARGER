# atari2600SUPERCHARGER
99% of this is not my own work but the great work of the vintage computing community 


linux to atari 2600 guide

dependencies 
------------
wine for linux

How to use
-----------
chmod +x maketwofile.sh
./maketwofile.sh

enter just the name of your .asm file without the .asm extension (the script handles that) 

Now in order to output to the atari's supercharger you need to just play the audio some how I used 'play' for debian
